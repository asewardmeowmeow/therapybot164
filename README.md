TherapyBot164 is a text to text ai bot meant to help you through your emotions and feelings. 
It uses two seperate models, those being StarChat and Zephyr. You can compare the response from these different models to your response to use which one you prefer.
There are three seperate options for you to choose how you want the chatbot to response to you, those being empathetic, helpful, and understanding. 
This uses a Gradio interface and HuggingFace models, so a Huggingface token is required to use the code. 
This code also uses transformers, those being AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoTokenizer, and pipeline. 
There is also a saveData element to this, which can be removed. If you would like to use it, then change the csv file to a drive location of your liking. 
The only things that need to be changed are the csv file and teh hugging face token. Other than that, use the code to your liking!
